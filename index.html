            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, My name is Khanh and I came to the US in December 27th 2025. Studying abroad in the United States has been one of the biggest turning points of my life. 
               From living independently to adapting to a new culture, my journey as an international student 
               has changed the way I think, study, and grow.</p>
               <p> I currently study in Washington State, surrounded by friendly people, clean nature, 
               and a supportive college environment. Although I miss my family and Vietnamese food, 
               every challenge teaches me something new and pushes me to become a stronger version of myself.
    </p>
